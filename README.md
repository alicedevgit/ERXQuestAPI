# ERXQuestAPI
An API for a questionnaire application[https://github.com/alicedevgit/ERXQuestWebApp.git] 

# Technologies
- .Net Core web API
- Entity Framework Core
- Json
- MVC
- LinQ

# Database
To manage data whitin this project, I use Entity Framework Core connected SQL Server  and you could use Database Creating Script under path: DB > ERXSQLScript

This script also included inserting script for initial data.

* As this is data relational, so if you would see data dictionary, please ask from me later.
* I put connection string for SQL Server in "appsettings.json" file, so you could edit it there.

# Other Data Soures
For some multi chioces which could be a huge data such as Countries and Occupation, I put them under folder: "Sources" as the same format in Json file.

# Finally
As this is an exam. And the requirement comes without any workflows. Actually before start the project I have to discuss more details with you first to meet real specification.
Anyway, while testing, you may found some parts which did't work as you hope, so please feel free to tell me about that.
